**Functionality**: Multi-factor risk scoring algorithm for automated escalation decisions
- ✅ **Security Risk Assessment**: Pattern-based detection of security-sensitive changes
- ✅ **Complexity Analysis**: LOC, file count, and cross-cutting concern assessment
- ✅ **Impact Assessment**: API, configuration, and production change evaluation
- ✅ **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Past failure pattern recognition
- ✅ **Time Pressure Evaluation**: Urgency and deadline pressure factors
- ✅ **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**: Configurable risk factor weights (Security 40%, Complexity 20%, Impact 20%, Historical 10%, Time 10%)

**Key Features**:
- Configurable risk weights and thresholds
- Comprehensive reasoning generation for decisions
- Confidence scoring based on data quality
- Support for multiple specialist routing decisions

### 2. Security Pattern Matcher (`security_pattern_matcher.py`)
