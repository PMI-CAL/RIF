## Core Components

### 1. Enhanced RIF-Validator (Test Architect)

**Identity Transformation**: Professional "Test Architect with Quality Advisory Authority"

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Evidence-based verification of all completion claims
- Risk assessment and automatic escalation
- Quality score calculation using deterministic formula
- Shadow quality issue management
- Adversarial testing coordination

**Evidence Requirements Matrix**:

| Completion Type | Mandatory Evidence | Verification Method | Threshold |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Feature Complete | Unit tests + Integration tests + Coverage report | Automated test execution | All pass, >80% coverage |
| Bug Fixed | Regression test + Root cause analysis + Fix verification | Test execution + Documentation review | Regression test passes |
| Performance Improved | Baseline + Current metrics + Analysis | Benchmark comparison | Measurable improvement |

### 2. Shadow Quality Tracking System

**Architecture**:
- Parallel `quality:issue-{number}` issues for independent quality assessment
- Continuous quality monitoring throughout main issue lifecycle
- Independent audit trail for all quality decisions
- Parallel orchestration opportunities for RIF-Validator

**Quality Issue Lifecycle**:
```
Main Issue Created → Quality Issue Auto-Created → Continuous Monitoring → Quality Assessment → Shadow Issue Closed
```

### 3. Evidence Framework

**Evidence Collection Process**:
1. **RIF-Implementer**: Generates evidence during implementation
2. **Evidence Repository**: Centralized storage and indexing
3. **RIF-Validator**: Verifies evidence completeness and validity
4. **Quality Scoring**: Deterministic calculation based on evidence

**Evidence Types**:
- **Test Evidence**: Unit, integration, E2E test results
- **Coverage Evidence**: Code coverage reports and analysis
- **Performance Evidence**: Benchmark results and comparisons
- **Security Evidence**: Security scan results and assessments
- **Documentation Evidence**: Complete technical documentation

### 4. Risk Assessment Engine

**Automatic Risk Detection Triggers**:
- Security/auth/payment files modified
- Large diffs (>500 lines)
- No tests added with implementation
- Previous validation failures
- High complexity indicators

**Risk Levels and Response**:
- **Low Risk**: Quick verification, standard evidence
- **Medium Risk**: Normal verification, full evidence suite
- **High Risk**: Skeptical review, enhanced evidence, adversarial testing
- **Critical Risk**: Deep verification, security review, multiple validators

### 5. Deterministic Quality Scoring

**Formula**: `Quality Score = 100 - (20 × FAIL_COUNT) - (10 × CONCERN_COUNT)`

**Decision Matrix**:
- **PASS** (≥80): All quality gates met, ready for completion
- **CONCERNS** (60-79): Minor issues, may proceed with monitoring
- **FAIL** (<60): Significant issues, must return to implementation
- **WAIVED** (Any score): Manual override with documented rationale

## Parallel Execution Architecture

### States and Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> new
    new --> analyzing
    analyzing --> planning
    planning --> architecting
    architecting --> implementing
    
    implementing --> skeptical_review : risk >= medium
    implementing --> validating : risk < medium
    
    skeptical_review --> evidence_gathering : evidence incomplete
    evidence_gathering --> validating : evidence complete
    
    validating --> implementing : quality_score < 60
    validating --> documenting : quality_score >= 80
    
    quality_tracking --> complete : main_issue_complete
    
    documenting --> complete
```

### Parallel Execution Rules

1. **Shadow Quality Tracking**: Runs parallel to entire main issue lifecycle
2. **Skeptical Review**: Can run parallel to implementing/architecting for high-risk changes
3. **Evidence Gathering**: Sequential after skeptical review identifies gaps
4. **Resource Isolation**: Parallel states don't conflict or block each other

  },

}
```

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

```python
def calculate_risk_level(changes):
    risk_score = 0
    
    # File-based risk assessment
    if any(path.match("**/security/**") for path in changes.files):
        risk_score += 40
    if any(path.match("**/auth/**") for path in changes.files):
        risk_score += 40
    if any(path.match("**/payment/**") for path in changes.files):
        risk_score += 50
    
    # Size-based risk assessment
    if changes.lines_modified > 500:
        risk_score += 30
    elif changes.lines_modified > 100:
        risk_score += 15
    
    # Test coverage risk
    if not changes.has_new_tests:
        risk_score += 25
    
    # Determine risk level
    if risk_score >= 70: return "critical"
    elif risk_score >= 50: return "high"  
    elif risk_score >= 25: return "medium"
    else: return "low"
```

### Quality Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_quality_score(evidence):
    base_score = 100
    fail_count = sum(1 for item in evidence if item.status == "FAIL")
    concern_count = sum(1 for item in evidence if item.status == "CONCERN")
    
    quality_score = base_score - (20 * fail_count) - (10 * concern_count)
    
    return max(0, quality_score)  # Minimum score is 0

def determine_quality_decision(score):
    if score >= 80: return "PASS"
    elif score >= 60: return "CONCERNS" 
    else: return "FAIL"
```
