## üö® False Positive Prevention Mechanisms

### Issue #225 Prevention Verified ‚úÖ

The framework specifically prevents the Issue #225 scenario through:

1. **Mandatory Integration Testing**: Cannot validate without actual Claude Desktop connection
2. **Evidence Authenticity**: Validates all evidence is real and not fabricated  
3. **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Flags suspiciously perfect results
4. **Production Simulation**: Tests under realistic conditions
5. **Adversarial Testing**: Challenges optimistic assumptions
6. **Peer Validation**: Recommends independent verification for suspicious results

### Detection Capabilities

- **Perfect Success Rate Detection**: Flags success rates >98% as suspicious
- **Impossible Timing Detection**: Flags execution times <10ms as fabricated
- **Resource Usage Anomalies**: Detects impossibly low CPU/memory usage
- **Evidence Inconsistencies**: Identifies contradictory evidence items
- **Pattern Repetition**: Detects identical results across validations
- **Temporal Clustering**: Identifies suspiciously frequent validations
