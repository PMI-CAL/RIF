4. **RIFDatabase** (`knowledge/database/database_interface.py`)
   - Unified interface for all database operations
   - Entity, relationship, and agent memory management
   - Performance monitoring and maintenance functions

5. **Schema Management** (`knowledge/schema/duckdb_simple_schema.sql`)
   - Automated table creation with proper constraints
   - FLOAT[768] vector storage for embeddings
   - Performance indexes and analytical views

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Test Results (100% Success Rate)
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ All basic operations working
- **Entity Storage**: 2.4 entities/sec with embeddings
- **Query Performance**: <5ms average for lookups
- **Memory Management**: Within 500MB limits during all tests

- **Vector Operations**: Both VSS and Python fallback working

### Memory Management
- **Configured Limit**: 500MB (Issue #26 requirement)
- **Actual Usage**: Within limits during stress testing
- **Pool Management**: Automatic connection cleanup
- **Resource Monitoring**: Built-in statistics and health checks

## 🔧 Key Features

### Database Operations
- Entity storage with metadata and embeddings

- Agent memory storage for learning and context
- Full CRUD operations with transaction support

### Vector Search Capabilities
- FLOAT[768] embedding storage (compatible with common models)
- VSS extension integration for high-performance similarity search
- Python fallback ensures functionality without VSS extension
- Hybrid text + vector search for comprehensive results

### Connection Management
- Thread-safe connection pooling (5 max connections, configurable)
- Automatic connection lifecycle management
- Idle connection cleanup (5-minute timeout)
- Connection health monitoring and recovery

### Configuration Flexibility
- Environment variable support for deployment
- Memory limits configurable from 100MB to several GB
- Connection pool sizing based on workload requirements
- VSS extension can be enabled/disabled per environment

## 🧪 Testing Evidence

### Core Functionality Test Results
```
🎉 All core tests passed!
✅ Issue #26 core requirements met:
   - DuckDB embedded database operational
   - Memory limits configurable and working  
   - Connection pooling implemented
   - Entity storage and retrieval working
   - Relationship management functional
   - Agent memory storage operational
   - Thread-safe operations verified
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Entity Storage**: 50 entities with embeddings in 20.54s (2.4/sec)
- **Query Performance**: 50 entities retrieved in 2ms
- **Relationship Creation**: 10 relationships in 25ms
- **Memory Usage**: Stayed within 50MB during testing

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Ready for Epic #24 Integration
- **Knowledge System**: Direct integration via RIFDatabase interface
- **Agent Memory**: Stores agent conversations with embeddings
- **Code Analysis**: Entity and relationship graph storage
- **Embedding Pipeline**: Direct vector storage with metadata

### API Example
```python
from knowledge.database import RIFDatabase, DatabaseConfig

# Initialize database with 500MB memory limit
config = DatabaseConfig(memory_limit="500MB", max_connections=5)
with RIFDatabase(config) as db:
    # Store code entity with embedding
    entity_id = db.store_entity({
        'type': 'function',
        'name': 'example_function',
        'file_path': '/src/example.py',
        'embedding': embedding_vector,
        'metadata': {'complexity': 'low'}
    })
    
    # Vector similarity search
    similar = db.similarity_search(
        query_embedding=query_vector,
        limit=10,
        threshold=0.7
    )
```

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Configuration Options
```bash
# Environment variables for deployment
export RIF_DB_MEMORY_LIMIT="500MB"
export RIF_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS="5"
export RIF_DB_ENABLE_VSS="true"
export RIF_DB_PATH="/data/rif_knowledge.duckdb"
```

### Docker/Production Considerations
- Memory limits enforced at database level
- File-based database supports volume mounting
- Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
- Graceful degradation when VSS extension unavailable

## 📈 Next Steps for Integration

1. **Immediate**: Ready for RIF-Validator testing
2. **Epic #24**: Database interface ready for knowledge system integration
3. **Performance**: Consider connection pool tuning for production workloads
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in statistics ready for dashboard integration

## 🔍 Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### Embedding Storage: FLOAT[768] vs BLOB
- **Decision**: Use DuckDB FLOAT[768] arrays
- **Rationale**: Better compatibility with VSS extension and native vector functions
- **Trade-off**: Slightly larger storage vs better query performance

### VSS Extension Strategy
- **Decision**: Support VSS with Python fallback
- **Rationale**: VSS not available in all DuckDB installations
- **Trade-off**: Complexity vs reliability across environments

### Connection Pooling Approach
- **Decision**: Custom thread-safe pool manager
- **Rationale**: Fine-grained control over resource usage and cleanup
- **Trade-off**: Implementation complexity vs resource efficiency
