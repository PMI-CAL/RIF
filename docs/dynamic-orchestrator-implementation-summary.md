## Key Innovations

### 1. Hybrid Graph-Based State Machine
Combines the flexibility of graph traversal with the reliability of state machine validation, enabling sophisticated workflow patterns while maintaining system integrity.

### 2. Evidence-Based Dynamic Routing
Decisions driven by concrete evidence (test results, quality gates, validation outputs) rather than simple rule-based logic, ensuring intelligent and reliable workflow progression.

### 3. Multi-Factor Confidence Scoring
Sophisticated confidence calculation considering evidence quality, pattern matches, agent consensus, historical success, context completeness, and validation reliability.

### 4. Resource-Aware Parallel Execution
Intelligent resource allocation preventing bottlenecks while maximizing parallel execution efficiency with comprehensive conflict resolution.

### 5. Intelligent Loop-Back Capability
Context-aware returns to previous states based on error categorization, complexity assessment, and evidence quality, optimizing workflow efficiency.
