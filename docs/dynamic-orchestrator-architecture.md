# Dynamic Orchestrator Architecture

## Issue #51: Graph-Based Dynamic Orchestration System

**Agent**: RIF-Architect  
**Design Pattern**: Hybrid Graph-Based State Machine with Evidence-Based Dynamic Routing  
**Components**: 4 core + 3 integration layers  
**Dependencies**: Enterprise Orchestrator Pattern (0.97), Multi-Layer Adaptive Architecture (0.85)

## Executive Summary

This architecture transforms RIF from a linear state machine into an intelligent, graph-based workflow engine that supports non-linear state transitions, adaptive decision-making, and parallel execution paths. The design builds upon the proven Enterprise Orchestrator Pattern while adding sophisticated routing intelligence and loop-back capabilities.

### Key Innovations

1. **Dynamic State Graph**: Any-to-any state transitions based on intelligent decision evaluation
2. **Evidence-Based Routing**: Context-aware decision points with confidence scoring
3. **Adaptive Parallel Execution**: Concurrent workflow paths with resource management
4. **Intelligent Loop-Back**: Smart returns to previous states based on validation results

## Current System Analysis

### Linear Workflow Limitations

The existing `rif-workflow.yaml` defines a primarily linear progression with limited loop-back:

```
new → analyzing → planning → architecting → implementing → validating → learning → complete
```

**Identified Limitations**:
1. **Rigid State Progression**: Limited loop-back to only adjacent or specific states
2. **Binary Decision Points**: Simple trigger/condition pairs without confidence scoring  
3. **Context-Insensitive Routing**: Decisions don't consider full workflow context
4. **Limited Parallel Execution**: Only specific states support parallel execution
5. **No Adaptive Learning**: No mechanism to improve routing decisions over time

### Transition Analysis

Current workflow has 28 state transitions, but most follow linear progression:
- **Forward Progression**: 18 transitions (64%)
- **Loop-Back Transitions**: 6 transitions (21%) - mostly validation → implementation
- **Recovery Transitions**: 4 transitions (14%)

**Gap Analysis**:
- No direct analysis ← validation loop-back for requirement clarification
- No planning ← validation route for strategic reconsideration
- Limited context-aware decision making
- No parallel validation during implementation

**Dynamic Team Composition**:
```python
# Example: Security-critical complex implementation
context = {
    'complexity': 'high',
    'security_critical': True,
    'required_skills': ['system_design', 'security_analysis'],
    'max_team_size': 4
}

# Result: [RIF-Security, RIF-Architect, RIF-Implementer, RIF-Validator]
team = selector.compose_dynamic_team(context)
```
