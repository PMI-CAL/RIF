## Design Decisions

### 1. Pattern: Multi-Layer Adaptive Architecture
**Choice**: 5-layer intelligence engine with dependency injection  
**Rationale**: 
- Complex ML-like system requires clear separation of concerns
- Independent optimization capabilities per layer
- High testability and maintainability
- Proven success pattern (confidence: 0.85)

### 2. Technology: Python with Interface-Driven Design
**Choice**: Abstract base classes defining layer interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Enables independent layer development and testing
- Supports multiple implementation strategies
- Facilitates performance optimization per layer
- Maintains consistency with existing RIF codebase

### 3. Integration: DynamicOrchestrator Plugin Architecture
**Choice**: AgentSelectionEngineInterface integration  
**Rationale**:
- Minimal impact on existing orchestrator code
- Clean separation of concerns
- Fallback strategies for reliability
- Performance optimization through caching

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path Components
1. **IssueContextAnalyzer** → Foundation for all other layers
2. **AgentCapabilityMapper** → Required for team composition
3. **DynamicTeamComposer** → Core optimization engine
4. **AdaptiveAgentSelectionEngine** → Main orchestrator

### Circular Risks: None Detected
- All layers have unidirectional dependencies
- Clean data flow from context → selection
- Learning system operates on outcome feedback only

### External Dependencies
- **DynamicOrchestrator**: Integration interface (Issue #52)
- **Knowledge System**: Historical patterns and metrics
- **GitHub API**: Issue context and feedback
- **Agent Registry**: Capability definitions and performance data
