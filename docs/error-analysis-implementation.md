## Integration with RIF Workflow

### 1. Automatic Activation
The error analysis system integrates seamlessly with the existing RIF workflow:
- Errors are automatically detected through Claude Code hooks
- Critical errors trigger immediate RIF-Error-Analyst activation
- Pattern analysis runs continuously in the background
- Results are integrated into the RIF knowledge base

### 2. GitHub Integration
- Critical errors automatically create GitHub issues
- Error analysis results are posted as issue comments
- Labels are applied for categorization and routing
- Solutions are tracked through issue resolution

### 3. Agent Orchestration
The RIF-Error-Analyst can be launched alongside other agents:
```python
Task(
    description="RIF-Error-Analyst: Investigate critical error pattern",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Error-Analyst. Investigate the critical error pattern detected in issue #X. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-error-analyst.md."
)
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Manual Error Analysis
```bash
# Capture and analyze an error
python3 claude/commands/error-analysis.py --capture "Database connection failed" \
  --context '{"server": "db-primary", "timeout": 30}' \
  --command "connect_db" --exit-code 1

# Check current metrics
python3 claude/commands/error-analysis.py --metrics
```

### 2. Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Start continuous error monitoring
python3 claude/commands/error-monitor.py --start-monitoring

# Check monitoring status
python3 claude/commands/error-monitor.py --status
```

### 3. Pattern Analysis
```bash
# Run pattern analysis once
python3 claude/commands/error-monitor.py --check-patterns
```

## Quality Gates and SLAs

### Error Response Times
- **Critical Errors**: Immediate analysis (< 1 minute)
- **High Severity**: Analysis within 5 minutes
- **Medium Severity**: Analysis within 1 hour

- Access controls protect error analysis results
- Audit trails track all error handling actions

### 2. Adversarial Analysis
- Automatic security impact assessment for all errors
- Potential attack vector identification
- Assumption testing and validation
- Edge case exploration for security vulnerabilities
