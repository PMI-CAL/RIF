# RIF - Reactive Intelligence Framework

An automatic intelligent development system that orchestrates specialized agents through GitHub issues with zero manual intervention.

## üö® CRITICAL: How RIF Orchestration Actually Works

**IMPORTANT**: The RIF Orchestrator is NOT a Task to launch. Claude Code IS the orchestrator.

### Correct Orchestration Pattern
When asked to "orchestrate" or "launch RIF orchestrator":
1. **Claude Code directly** checks GitHub issues (not via Task)
2. **Claude Code directly** analyzes states and determines which agents need launching
3. **Claude Code launches MULTIPLE Task agents in ONE response** for parallel execution

### ‚ùå WRONG: Claude Doing Work Directly
```bash
# This is INCORRECT - Claude doing implementation work:
Edit(file_path="/path/to/file.js", old_string="...", new_string="...")
# Or Claude analyzing requirements without launching agents
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Claude Launching Agents
```python
# When orchestrating, Claude Code should execute (in a single response):
Task(
    description="RIF-Analyst for issue #3",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Analyst. Analyze issue #3 about LightRAG usage. [Include full rif-analyst.md instructions]"
)
Task(
    description="RIF-Implementer for issue #2", 
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Implementer. Implement fix for issue #2. [Include full rif-implementer.md instructions]"
)
# These Tasks run IN PARALLEL because they're in the same response
```

### Real-World Orchestration Examples

#### Example 1: New Issue Detected
```python
# User: "Orchestrate RIF to handle the open issues"
# Claude Code should respond with:

Task(
    description="RIF-Analyst: Analyze issue #5 requirements",
    subagent_type="general-purpose", 
    prompt="You are RIF-Analyst. Analyze GitHub issue #5 titled 'Add user authentication'. Extract requirements, identify patterns from knowledge base, assess complexity. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-analyst.md."
)
Task(
    description="RIF-Implementer: Implement issue #3 fix",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Implementer. Implement the fix for GitHub issue #3 'Database connection pooling'. Use checkpoints for progress tracking. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-implementer.md."
)
```

#### Example 2: Multiple States Need Processing  
```python
# When multiple issues are in different states:

Task(
    description="RIF-Validator: Validate issue #1 implementation", 
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Validator. Validate the implementation for GitHub issue #1. Run tests, check quality gates, ensure standards compliance. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-validator.md."
)
Task(
    description="RIF-Planner: Plan architecture for issue #4",
    subagent_type="general-purpose", 
    prompt="You are RIF-Planner. Create detailed plan for GitHub issue #4 'Microservices migration'. Assess complexity, create workflow. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-planner.md."
)
Task(
    description="RIF-Learner: Update knowledge from completed issue #2",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Learner. Extract learnings from completed GitHub issue #2. Update knowledge base with patterns, decisions, metrics. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-learner.md."
)
```

#### Example 3: Single Issue Full Workflow
```python
# For a complex issue requiring multiple agents in sequence:

Task(
    description="RIF-Analyst: Deep analysis of complex issue #7",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Analyst. Perform deep analysis of GitHub issue #7 'Real-time data processing pipeline'. This is a high-complexity task requiring thorough requirements analysis. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-analyst.md."
)
Task(
    description="RIF-Architect: Design system for issue #7", 
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Architect. Design the system architecture for GitHub issue #7 based on RIF-Analyst findings. Create detailed technical design. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-architect.md."
)
```

### What "Task.parallel()" Means
Documentation references to `Task.parallel()` are **pseudocode** meaning:
"Launch multiple Task tool invocations in a single Claude response"

It is NOT a real function - it represents the pattern of parallel Task execution.

## üß† ORCHESTRATION INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK

**CRITICAL**: Before launching any agents, the orchestrator MUST perform intelligent dependency analysis.

### Dependency Analysis Process (MANDATORY)

**Step 1: Issue Dependency Mapping**
```python
# BEFORE launching agents, analyze:
# 1. Sequential Dependencies: Research ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation
# 2. Foundational Dependencies: Core systems before dependent features  
# 3. Blocking Dependencies: Critical infrastructure before all other work
# 4. Integration Dependencies: APIs before integrations that use them
```

**Step 2: Critical Path Identification**
- **Blocking Issues**: Must complete before ANY other work (e.g., agent context reading failures)
- **Foundation Issues**: Core systems that other issues depend on
- **Sequential Phases**: Research/Architecture must complete before Implementation
- **Integration Issues**: Cannot start until prerequisite APIs/schemas exist

**Step 3: Intelligent Launch Decision**
```python
# DECISION FRAMEWORK:
if blocking_issues_exist:
    launch_agents_for_blocking_issues_ONLY()
elif foundation_incomplete and has_dependent_issues:
    launch_agents_for_foundation_issues_ONLY()  
elif research_phase_incomplete:
    launch_agents_for_research_issues_ONLY()
else:
    launch_parallel_agents_for_ready_issues()
```

### Orchestration Decision Examples

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Naive Parallel Launching
```python
# This ignores dependencies and wastes agent resources:
Task("Implement feature X", ...)  # Depends on incomplete research
Task("Validate feature Y", ...)   # Nothing to validate yet  
Task("Integrate system Z", ...)   # APIs don't exist yet
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Dependency-Aware Orchestration
```python  
# First: Handle blocking issues
if critical_infrastructure_broken:
    Task("Fix agent context reading", ...)
    # STOP - no other work until this completes

# Then: Foundation before dependent work
elif core_apis_incomplete:
    Task("Implement core API framework", ...)
    Task("Create database schema", ...)
    # STOP - dependent work waits

# Then: Research before implementation  
elif research_incomplete:
    Task("Research live context architecture", ...)
    Task("Research dependency tracking", ...)
    # STOP - implementation waits

# Finally: Parallel work on ready issues
else:
    Task("Implement validated feature A", ...)
    Task("Implement validated feature B", ...)
```

### Key Rules for Intelligent Orchestration

1. **ANALYZE DEPENDENCIES FIRST** - Never launch agents without dependency analysis
2. **RESPECT SEQUENTIAL PHASES** - Research ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation
3. **PRIORITIZE BLOCKING ISSUES** - Critical infrastructure before all other work
4. **ONE PHASE AT A TIME** - Don't start implementation until research/architecture complete
5. **NEVER do implementation work directly** - Always delegate to agents
6. **Launch multiple Tasks in ONE response** for parallel execution (when appropriate)
7. **Include full agent instructions** in the Task prompt
8. **Match agents to issue states** (analyst for state:new, implementer for state:implementing, etc.)
9. **Let agents handle GitHub interactions** (posting comments, changing labels)
10. **Trust the agent specialization** - Don't micromanage their work

## üö® CRITICAL: Enhanced Orchestration Intelligence (Issue #228)

**ISSUE #228 INTEGRATION**: Following the critical orchestration failure where Issue #225 declared "THIS ISSUE BLOCKS ALL OTHERS" but was ignored, RIF now includes enhanced blocking detection that prevents such failures.

### Enhanced Blocking Detection System

The enhanced orchestration intelligence includes sophisticated blocking detection that:
- **Scans issue bodies and comments** for explicit blocking declarations
- **Halts all orchestration** when blocking issues are detected
- **Prevents false positives** by requiring exact blocking phrases
- **Provides detailed analysis** of why orchestration was blocked

### Supported Blocking Declarations

The system detects these exact phrases (case-insensitive):
- "**THIS ISSUE BLOCKS ALL OTHERS**"
- "**THIS ISSUE BLOCKS ALL OTHER WORK**"
- "**BLOCKS ALL OTHER WORK**"
- "**BLOCKS ALL OTHERS**"
- "**STOP ALL WORK**"
- "**MUST COMPLETE BEFORE ALL**"
- "**MUST COMPLETE BEFORE ALL OTHER WORK**"
- "**MUST COMPLETE BEFORE ALL OTHERS**"

**Note**: Generic terms like "critical", "urgent", or "blocking" alone do NOT trigger blocking detection to prevent false positives.

### Orchestration Intelligence Integration

Enhanced orchestration includes three levels of intelligence:

#### 1. Pre-Flight Blocking Detection
```python
from claude.commands.orchestration_intelligence_integration import validate_orchestration_request

# MANDATORY: Check for blocking issues before any orchestration
should_block, message = validate_orchestration_request([225, 226, 227])

if should_block:
    print(f"üö® ORCHESTRATION BLOCKED: {message}")
    return  # Do not proceed with orchestration
```

#### 2. Intelligent Orchestration Decision
```python
from claude.commands.orchestration_intelligence_integration import make_intelligent_orchestration_decision

# Generate intelligent orchestration plan with blocking detection
decision = make_intelligent_orchestration_decision([225, 226, 227])

if decision.enforcement_action == "HALT_ALL_ORCHESTRATION":
    print(f"üö® BLOCKING ISSUES DETECTED: {decision.blocking_issues}")
    print(f"üö´ BLOCKED ISSUES: {decision.blocked_issues}")
    print(f"‚úÖ ALLOWED WORK: Only {decision.allowed_issues}")
    
    # Launch only blocking issue tasks
    for task_code in decision.task_launch_codes:
        exec(task_code)  # Execute the Task() commands for blocking issues only
    return

# Normal orchestration for non-blocking scenarios
for task_code in decision.task_launch_codes:
    exec(task_code)
```

#### 3. Pre-Flight Validation Command
```bash
# Standalone validation tool for blocking detection
python claude/commands/pre_flight_blocking_validator.py --issues 225,226,227

# Output:
# üö® RESULT: HALT ORCHESTRATION - 1 blocking issues detected
# or
# ‚úÖ RESULT: ALLOW ORCHESTRATION - No blocking issues detected
```

### Orchestration Failure Prevention

The enhanced system prevents these critical failures:
1. **Ignoring explicit blocking declarations** (like Issue #225)
2. **Proceeding with parallel work** when blocking issues exist
3. **False positive blocking** from generic urgent language
4. **Missed blocking declarations** in issue comments

### Enhanced Orchestration Example

**Scenario**: Issues #225 (with "THIS ISSUE BLOCKS ALL OTHERS"), #226, and #227

**Before Issue #228 Fix**:
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Would launch all tasks in parallel
Task("Work on issue #225", ...)
Task("Work on issue #226", ...)  # Should be blocked!
Task("Work on issue #227", ...)  # Should be blocked!
```

**After Issue #228 Fix**:
```python
from claude.commands.orchestration_intelligence_integration import make_intelligent_orchestration_decision

decision = make_intelligent_orchestration_decision([225, 226, 227])

# System detects Issue #225 blocks others:
# decision.enforcement_action == "HALT_ALL_ORCHESTRATION"
# decision.blocking_issues == [225]
# decision.blocked_issues == [226, 227]

# Only launches task for blocking issue:
Task(
    description="Resolve BLOCKING issue #225 (THIS ISSUE BLOCKS ALL OTHERS)",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Implementer. Resolve BLOCKING issue #225 immediately. This issue blocks all other work. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/rif-implementer.md."
)
# Issues #226 and #227 are automatically blocked until #225 completes
```

### Quick Reference: Intelligent Agent Launching Template (ENHANCED for Issue #223 & #228)

```python
# Step 1: Check GitHub issues (Claude Code does this directly)
github_issues = get_current_github_issues()  # Claude Code handles this

# Step 2: MANDATORY BLOCKING DETECTION (CRITICAL FIX for Issue #228)
from claude.commands.orchestration_intelligence_integration import make_intelligent_orchestration_decision

# CRITICAL: Enhanced blocking detection prevents orchestration failures
orchestration_decision = make_intelligent_orchestration_decision(github_issues)

# Handle blocking issues FIRST (Issue #228 fix)
if orchestration_decision.enforcement_action == "HALT_ALL_ORCHESTRATION":
    print("üö® BLOCKING ISSUES DETECTED - HALTING ALL OTHER ORCHESTRATION")
    print(f"   Blocking Issues: {orchestration_decision.blocking_issues}")
    print(f"   Blocked Issues: {orchestration_decision.blocked_issues}")
    print("   ACTION: Complete blocking issues before proceeding with others")
    
    # Execute ONLY blocking issue tasks
    for task_code in orchestration_decision.task_launch_codes:
        # Task codes are ready-to-execute strings
        exec(task_code)
    return  # Do not proceed with other issues

# Step 3: PHASE DEPENDENCY ENFORCEMENT (Issue #223)
from claude.commands.simple_phase_dependency_enforcer import enforce_orchestration_phase_dependencies

# Define proposed agent launches (only for non-blocking issues)
proposed_agent_launches = [
    {
        "description": "[AGENT_NAME]: [BRIEF_TASK_DESCRIPTION]",
        "prompt": "You are [AGENT_NAME]. [SPECIFIC_TASK_DETAILS]. Follow all instructions in claude/agents/[agent-file].md.",
        "subagent_type": "general-purpose"
    }
    # Add more proposed launches...
]

# ENFORCE PHASE DEPENDENCIES
enforcement_result = enforce_orchestration_phase_dependencies(github_issues, proposed_agent_launches)

# Step 4: Execute based on combined enforcement decision
if not enforcement_result.is_execution_allowed:
    print("‚ùå PHASE DEPENDENCY VIOLATIONS - EXECUTION BLOCKED")
    print(f"Decision: {enforcement_result.decision_type.value}")
    print("Violations:")
    for violation in enforcement_result.violations:
        print(f"  - {violation}")
    print("Required Actions:")  
    for action in enforcement_result.remediation_actions:
        print(f"  ‚Üí {action}")
    
    # Execute prerequisite tasks instead of blocked tasks
    print("\nüîÑ EXECUTING PREREQUISITE TASKS:")
    for task in enforcement_result.prerequisite_tasks:
        Task(
            description=task["description"],
            subagent_type=task["subagent_type"], 
            prompt=task["prompt"]
        )
        
else:
    print("‚úÖ ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED - PROCEEDING WITH EXECUTION")
    print(f"Phase Decision: {enforcement_result.decision_type.value}")
    print(f"Blocking Decision: {orchestration_decision.enforcement_action}")
    print(f"Confidence: {enforcement_result.confidence_score:.2f}")
    
    # Execute validated tasks in parallel
    for task in enforcement_result.allowed_tasks:
        Task(
            description=task["description"],
            subagent_type=task["subagent_type"],
            prompt=task["prompt"]
        )

# Enhanced Orchestration Status:

# Phase Dependency Enforcement: ‚úÖ ACTIVE (Issue #223)
# Sequential Phase Validation: ‚úÖ ENFORCED
# False Positive Prevention: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
```

### Intelligent Orchestration Scenarios

| Scenario | Dependency Analysis | Orchestration Decision | Agent Tasks |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Critical infrastructure broken** | Blocking issue affects all agents | Launch blocking agents ONLY | Fix context reading, repair core systems |
| **Foundation APIs missing** | Implementation depends on APIs | Launch foundation agents ONLY | Core API framework, database schema |
| **Research phase incomplete** | Implementation depends on research | Launch research agents ONLY | Architecture research, methodology analysis |
| **Multiple ready issues** | No blocking dependencies | Launch parallel agents | Multiple implementers/validators in parallel |
| **Mixed states with dependencies** | Some dependent, some ready | Prioritized sequential launch | Foundation first, then dependent work |
| **New issue in dependent chain** | Check position in dependency chain | Wait or immediate based on prerequisites | RIF-Analyst only if no blocking dependencies |

### DPIBS Orchestration Example

**Current State**: 25+ DPIBS issues in various states
**Problem**: Implementation/validation issues launched before research/architecture complete

**Correct Orchestration**:
1. **Phase 1** (Research): Issues #133-136 - Launch research agents ONLY
2. **Phase 2** (Architecture): Issues #117,#120-122 - Launch after research complete  
3. **Phase 3** (Implementation): Issues #123,#127-128,#137-138 - Launch after architecture complete
4. **Phase 4** (Validation): Issues #129-132 - Launch after implementation complete

### Troubleshooting Intelligent Orchestration

**Problem**: Claude is doing work directly instead of launching agents
**Solution**: Always use Task() tool to delegate work to specialized agents

**Problem**: Agents are not running in parallel  
**Solution**: Launch all Tasks in a single Claude response, not separate responses

**Problem**: Implementation agents launched for issues with incomplete prerequisites
**Solution**: Perform mandatory dependency analysis - check research/architecture completion first

**Problem**: Validation agents launched when nothing is ready to validate
**Solution**: Apply sequential phase logic - implementation must complete before validation

**Problem**: Multiple agents working on dependent issues causing conflicts
**Solution**: Use foundation-first orchestration - core systems before dependent features

**Problem**: Critical infrastructure issues ignored while other work proceeds  
**Solution**: Identify blocking issues first - launch blocking agents ONLY until resolved

**Problem**: Agent instructions are incomplete
**Solution**: Always include "Follow all instructions in claude/agents/[agent-file].md" in prompts

**Problem**: Orchestration decisions appear arbitrary or inefficient
**Solution**: Document dependency analysis reasoning before launching agents

## Architecture Overview

RIF operates as a **completely automatic** framework:
- GitHub issues trigger all workflows - no manual commands needed
- Specialized agents activate based on state labels
- LightRAG knowledge base learns from every interaction
- State machine manages workflow progression
- Quality gates enforce standards automatically

## Development Commands

RIF uses technology-agnostic command placeholders that adapt to your stack:

### Setup and Installation
```bash
# Initialize RIF for a project
./rif-init.sh

# Setup framework with technology detection
./setup.sh <project_directory>

# Check prerequisites (git, gh, jq)
./rif-init.sh
```

### Testing and Quality
The framework automatically detects your technology stack and uses appropriate commands:
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: npm test, npm run lint, npm run build
- **Python**: pytest, flake8/black, python setup.py build
- **Java**: mvn test, mvn checkstyle:check, mvn package
- **Go**: go test ./..., golangci-lint run, go build
- **Rust**: cargo test, cargo clippy, cargo build --release

To run tests in your project, check for:
1. package.json scripts (Node.js)
2. Makefile targets
3. pytest.ini or setup.cfg (Python)
4. pom.xml or build.gradle (Java)

## Agent System

### Core RIF Agents (Automatic Activation)

| Agent | Trigger Label | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| RIF-Analyst | `state:new` | Requirements analysis, pattern recognition |
| RIF-Planner | `state:planning` | Strategic planning, workflow configuration |
| RIF-Architect | `state:architecting` | System design, dependency graphs |
| RIF-Implementer | `state:implementing` | Code implementation, checkpoint tracking |
| RIF-Validator | `state:validating` | Testing, quality gate enforcement |
| RIF-Learner | `state:learning` | Knowledge base updates |

## Claude Code Integration

### Required Hooks Configuration

Add to `.claude/settings.json` for automatic RIF activation:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "gh issue list --state open --label 'state:*' --json number,title,labels,body | head -10 > /tmp/rif-context.json && echo 'RIF: Found '$(jq length /tmp/rif-context.json)' active issues'",
        "output": "context"
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": ".*issue.*|.*fix.*|.*implement.*|.*analyze.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "if [ -f ./knowledge/latest-patterns.json ]; then cat ./knowledge/latest-patterns.json; fi",
            "output": "context"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '{\"timestamp\": \"'$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")'\", \"action\": \"code_modified\"}' >> ./knowledge/events.jsonl"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## GitHub Workflow

### Creating Work Items

All work starts with GitHub issues:

```bash
# Create issue to trigger RIF
gh issue create --title "Implement feature X" --body "Description"

# RIF automatically:
# 1. Detects new issue
# 2. Applies state:new label
# 3. Triggers RIF-Analyst
# 4. Progresses through workflow
# 5. Posts results as comments
# 6. Creates PR if needed
# 7. Closes issue when complete
```

### Label System

RIF manages these labels automatically:
- `state:*` - Workflow state (new, analyzing, planning, etc.)
- `complexity:*` - Task complexity (low, medium, high, very-high)
- `agent:*` - Active agent tracking
- `priority:*` - Urgency level
- `learned:*` - New patterns discovered

## Quality Gates

Automatic enforcement without configuration:

| Gate | Threshold | Failure Action |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Test Coverage | >80% | Return to implementer |
| Security | No critical vulnerabilities | Block and alert |
| Performance | Meet baseline | Trigger optimization |
| Documentation | Complete | Generate automatically |

## Knowledge Base

### Automatic Learning System

RIF learns from every interaction:
- **Successful patterns** stored in `knowledge/patterns/`
- **Design decisions** tracked in `knowledge/decisions/`
- **Issue resolutions** saved in `knowledge/issues/`
- **Performance metrics** logged in `knowledge/metrics/`

### Pattern Application

When analyzing new issues, RIF:
1. Searches for similar past issues
2. Applies successful patterns
3. Avoids known failures
4. Documents new learnings

## Complexity Assessment

RIF automatically calibrates planning depth:

| Complexity | LOC | Files | Planning Depth | Agents |
|------------|-----|-------|----------------|---------|
| Low | <50 | 1 | Shallow | 2-3 |
| Medium | <500 | 2-5 | Standard | 3-4 |
| High | <2000 | 6-20 | Deep | 4-5 |
| Very High | >2000 | 20+ | Recursive | 5+ with sub-planning |

## Parallel Execution

Multi-agent configuration (`config/multi-agent.yaml`):
- Maximum 4 parallel subagents
- Resource limits per agent
- Communication bus for coordination
- Automatic retry on failure

## Recovery System

### Checkpoint Management

Checkpoints created automatically:
- After each agent completion
- Before risky operations
- On test failures
- Every 30 minutes

### Automatic Recovery

On failure, RIF:
1. Identifies last stable checkpoint
2. Restores to that state
3. Adjusts approach based on failure
4. Retries with modifications
5. Updates knowledge base

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize RIF**: Run `./rif-init.sh` in your project
2. **Configure Hooks**: Add settings to `.claude/settings.json`
3. **Create Issue**: `gh issue create --title "Your task"`
4. **Watch It Work**: RIF handles everything automatically

## Important Notes

- **NO MANUAL COMMANDS**: Everything triggers automatically via GitHub
- **TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC**: Works with any programming language
- **SELF-IMPROVING**: Gets smarter with each task
- **PRODUCTION READY**: Enterprise-grade quality gates
- **ZERO CONFIGURATION**: Works out of the box

## Troubleshooting

If RIF isn't responding:
1. Check GitHub labels are correct (`state:*`)
2. Verify hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
3. Ensure `gh` CLI is authenticated
4. Check `knowledge/` directory is accessible
5. Look for error comments in GitHub issue

The system will automatically detect stuck states and attempt self-recovery after timeout.
