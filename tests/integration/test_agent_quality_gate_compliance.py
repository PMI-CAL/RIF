Agent Quality Gate Compliance Integration Tests - Issue #268 Fix Validation

This test suite validates that RIF agents actually follow quality gate enforcement
instructions in practice, not just in theory. It tests the critical gap between
perfect instructions and actual agent behavior.

Test Focus:
- Real agent instruction compliance
- Prohibited reasoning pattern detection
- Binary decision enforcement validation
- Agent discretion prevention testing
