# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The RIF (Reactive Intelligence Framework) project actively supports the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. Please follow these guidelines when reporting security issues:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send security reports to: **security@rif-framework.org** (or repository owner if private)
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: 24 hours
- **Acknowledgment**: 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly (or as developments occur)
- **Resolution**: Target 90 days for critical issues

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels based on CVSS 3.1:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Description |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | 24 hours | Immediate threat to system security |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | 72 hours | Significant security risk |
| **Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | 1 week | Moderate security concern |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | 2 weeks | Minor security issue |

## Security Features

RIF implements multiple layers of security:

### Automated Security Scanning
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis for common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of committed secrets and credentials
- **Container Scanning**: Security analysis of Docker images (if applicable)

### Security Best Practices
- **Secure Defaults**: All configurations use secure defaults
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions required
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of all outputs
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Robust access controls

### Continuous Monitoring
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for all releases
- **Vulnerability Alerts**: Automated notification system
- **Security Metrics**: Continuous security posture monitoring
- **Compliance Checking**: Automated policy compliance validation

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Testing**: Include security test cases for new features
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
5. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information

### Security Checklist

Before submitting code, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling (no information leakage)
- [ ] Security tests included
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] OWASP guidelines followed
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented

## Security Architecture

### Agent Security Model
RIF agents operate with:
- **Isolated Execution**: Each agent runs in isolated context
- **Permission Boundaries**: Limited access to system resources
- **Audit Logging**: All agent actions are logged
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and network constraints

### GitHub Integration Security
- **Token Management**: Secure GitHub token handling
- **Branch Protection**: Enforce branch protection rules
- **PR Security Gates**: Automated security validation on pull requests
- **Workflow Security**: Secure GitHub Actions workflows

### Knowledge Base Security
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to knowledge base
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatic PII and secret detection
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with retention policies

## Incident Response Plan

### In Case of Security Breach

1. **Immediate Response** (0-2 hours):
   - Contain the incident
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation** (2-24 hours):
   - Determine root cause
   - Identify affected systems
   - Document timeline of events

3. **Recovery** (24-72 hours):
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore affected services
   - Validate security posture

4. **Post-Incident** (1-2 weeks):
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security measures
   - Communicate lessons learned
