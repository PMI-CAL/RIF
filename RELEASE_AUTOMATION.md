# GitHub Release Management Automation

Complete implementation of automated release management for the RIF (Reactive Intelligence Framework) project.

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that automates the entire release process including semantic versioning, changelog generation, asset building, deployment, and integration with the RIF workflow system.

## Features

### 🏷️ Semantic Versioning
- **Automatic version calculation** based on commit messages
- **Conventional commit support** (feat:, fix:, BREAKING:)
- **PR label integration** for version type determination
- **Prerelease detection** and handling

### 📝 Changelog Generation
- **Categorized changes** with emoji formatting
- **Automatic PR/commit linking** 
- **Full changelog comparisons** between versions
- **Installation instructions** included

### 📦 Asset Management
- **Source code archives** (tar.gz, zip)
- **Documentation bundles** with guides
- **Configuration templates** for easy setup
- **Checksum generation** (SHA256, MD5)
- **Automatic asset attachment** to releases

### 🚀 Multi-Environment Deployment
- **Production** - Manual approval required

## Files Structure

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   └── release-automation.yml      # Main workflow (687 lines)
├── scripts/
│   ├── release-utils.js           # Node.js utilities (200+ lines)
│   └── test-release-workflow.sh   # Test suite (300+ lines)
└── release-config.yml             # Configuration (200+ lines)
```

## Usage

### Automatic Release (Tag-based)
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3

# The workflow automatically triggers and creates a release
```

### Manual Release
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually with custom settings
gh workflow run release-automation.yml \
  -f version=v1.2.3 \
  -f prerelease=false \
  -f environment=production \
  -f build_assets=true \
  -f announce=true
```

### Development/Testing
```bash
# Create test release
gh workflow run release-automation.yml \
  -f version=v1.2.3-test \
  -f prerelease=true \
  -f environment=development
```

## Workflow Jobs

### 1. Version Analysis (`version-analysis`)
- Determines version from tag or manual input
- Analyzes commits for semantic versioning
- Generates comprehensive changelog
- Categorizes changes (features, fixes, breaking)

### 2. Asset Building (`build-assets`)
- Creates source code archives
- Bundles documentation
- Packages configuration templates
- Generates checksums for security

### 3. Release Creation (`create-release`)
- Creates GitHub Release via API
- Uploads all built assets
- Formats release notes with changelog
- Handles prerelease vs stable releases

### 4. Deployment (`deploy`)
- Deploys to specified environment
- Handles multi-environment scenarios  
- Provides deployment status tracking
- Integrates with deployment checks

### 5. RIF Integration (`rif-integration`)
- Updates related GitHub issues
- Manages workflow state transitions
- Updates knowledge base with release data
- Handles RIF label management

### 6. Announcements (`announce-release`)
- Creates announcement posts
- Updates README with version badge
- Posts to GitHub Discussions (if enabled)
- Manages release notifications

### 7. Validation (`post-release-validation`)
- Validates release was created successfully
- Checks asset attachment completion
- Verifies RIF integration worked
- Generates validation report

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable via `.github/release-config.yml`:

### Semantic Versioning Rules
```yaml
version_rules:
  major:
    patterns: ["BREAKING:", "breaking change", "💔", "!:"]
    labels: ["breaking-change", "major"]
  minor:
    patterns: ["feat:", "feature:", "🚀", "add ", "implement "]
    labels: ["feature", "enhancement", "minor"]
  patch:
    patterns: ["fix:", "bug:", "🐛", "hotfix", "patch"]
    labels: ["bugfix", "hotfix", "patch"]
```

### Changelog Categories
```yaml
categories:
  breaking:
    title: "💔 Breaking Changes"
    priority: 1
  features:
    title: "🚀 Features"
    priority: 2
  fixes:
    title: "🐛 Bug Fixes"
    priority: 3
```

### Asset Configuration
```yaml
assets:
  source_code: true
  documentation: true
  configuration_templates: true
  checksums:
    enabled: true
    algorithms: ["sha256", "md5"]
```

## Testing

### Test Suite Execution
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
./.github/scripts/test-release-workflow.sh
```

### Test Categories
- **File Structure** - Validates all files exist
- **YAML Syntax** - Checks workflow syntax  
- **GitHub Integration** - Verifies CLI access
- **Workflow Structure** - Validates job definitions
- **Permissions** - Checks GitHub API permissions
- **Semantic Versioning** - Tests version logic
- **Asset Management** - Validates build pipeline
- **RIF Integration** - Tests workflow integration
- **Environment Support** - Verifies deployment
- **Error Handling** - Tests failure scenarios
- **Documentation** - Validates inline docs

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test with actual workflow execution
gh workflow run release-automation.yml \
  -f version=v0.0.1-test \
  -f prerelease=true

# Monitor workflow execution
gh run list --workflow=release-automation.yml
```

## Security

### Permissions Required
- `contents: write` - Create releases and tags
- `issues: write` - Update issue states  
- `pull-requests: read` - Access PR information
- `actions: read` - Access workflow information

### Asset Security
- **Checksum generation** for all assets
- **Signature support** (configurable)
- **Vulnerability scanning** integration
- **Approval requirements** for sensitive releases

## Integration with RIF

### Workflow State Management
The release automation integrates with RIF's state machine:

```
state:implementing → state:validating → state:complete
```

### Issue Updates
- Automatically finds release-related issues
- Posts completion comments with release links
- Updates issue labels and states
- Creates knowledge base entries

### Knowledge Base Integration
```json
{
  "version": "v1.2.3",
  "release_date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "release_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v1.2.3",
  "version_type": "minor",
  "assets_built": true,
  "rif_integration": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not found**
- Ensure files are committed and pushed to main branch
- Check workflow file syntax with `yamllint`

**Permission denied**
- Verify GitHub token has required permissions
- Check repository settings for Actions permissions

**Asset upload failures**
- Ensure asset files exist in expected locations
- Check file size limits (GitHub has 2GB limit)

**RIF integration issues**
- Verify issue labels match configuration
- Check knowledge directory permissions

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting workflow variables:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

## Performance

### Workflow Execution Time
- **Version Analysis**: ~2 minutes
- **Asset Building**: ~3-5 minutes  
- **Release Creation**: ~1 minute
- **Deployment**: ~2-10 minutes (varies by environment)
- **Total Average**: ~10-18 minutes

### Optimization Features
- **Parallel job execution** where possible
- **Conditional job execution** based on inputs
- **Asset caching** for repeated builds
- **Early failure detection** and reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Docker image publishing** integration
- **NPM/PyPI package publishing** support
- **Slack/Discord notifications** 
- **Advanced approval workflows**
- **Release rollback capabilities**
- **A/B deployment strategies**

### Extension Points
The workflow is designed for extensibility:
- Custom asset builders
- Additional deployment targets  
- Enhanced notification systems
- Custom validation checks
