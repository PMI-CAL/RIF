## 🔍 User Validation Required

**Important**: This issue can only be closed by YOU, the issue creator.

When agents complete work on your issue, they will:
1. Request your validation
2. Wait for your confirmation
3. NOT close the issue themselves

**Your Response Options:**
- ✅ "Validated" - Issue is resolved and can be closed
- ❌ "Rejected" - Issue is not resolved, needs more work
- 🔍 "Needs Review" - Need more information before validating

This system prevents issues from being closed prematurely without your confirmation.
