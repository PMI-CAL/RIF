## MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Claude Code Capabilities Query (BEFORE ANY MAJOR DECISION)

**ALWAYS consult knowledge database before implementing or suggesting Claude Code features:**

1. **Query Claude Code Documentation**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` with relevant topic (e.g., "capabilities", "thinking budget", "tools")
   - Understand what Claude Code actually provides vs. what needs to be built
   - Verify no existing functionality is being recreated

2. **Query Knowledge Database for Patterns**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__query_knowledge` for similar issues and solutions
   - Search for relevant implementation patterns and architectural decisions
   - Check for compatibility with existing RIF system patterns

3. **Validate Approach Compatibility**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility` to verify approach aligns with Claude Code + RIF patterns
   - Ensure proposed solutions leverage existing capabilities rather than recreating them
   - Confirm technical approach is consistent with system architecture

### Knowledge Consultation Evidence Template (MANDATORY POST)

**EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT**: This agent is subject to Issue #230 emergency protocols. Any analysis work without proper documentation consultation will be immediately halted and returned for correction.

### MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION
**BEFORE ANY WORK OR DECISIONS:**
1. **Initialize Session**: `from claude.commands.knowledge_consultation_enforcer import get_knowledge_enforcer`
2. **Start Enforcement**: `session_key = enforcer.start_agent_session("rif-analyst", issue_id, task_description)`
3. **Record All MCP Usage**: `enforcer.record_knowledge_consultation(session_key, mcp_tool, query, result)`
4. **Request Decision Approval**: `approved = enforcer.request_decision_approval(session_key, decision_type, details)`

### Issue Decomposition Analysis

**Context Window Assessment**: 
- Estimated Total LOC: [number]
- Files Affected: [count]
- Complexity: [low/medium/high/very-high]
- Recommended Decomposition: [YES/NO]

**Proposed Sub-Issues** (if decomposition needed):
1. **Core Implementation** (< 500 LOC)
   - Specific components: [list]
   - Dependencies: [none/minimal]
   - Can be validated independently
   
2. **Integration Layer** (< 500 LOC)
   - Integration points: [list]
   - Dependencies: [sub-issue 1]
   - Parallel validation possible

3. **Test Suite** (< 500 LOC)
   - Test categories: [unit/integration/e2e]

### Evidence Requirements Analysis

Based on issue type and complexity:

**Required Evidence Categories**:

- [ ] Quality: code coverage, linting, type checking
- [ ] Documentation: API docs, user guides, comments

**Evidence Collection Points**:
1. Pre-implementation: baseline metrics
2. During implementation: incremental tests
3. Post-implementation: full validation suite
4. Continuous: quality tracking via shadow issue

### Parallel Validation Strategy

**Recommended Parallel Tracks**:
1. **Main Development**: RIF-Implementer on primary issue
2. **Quality Tracking**: Shadow issue for continuous monitoring
3. **Risk Assessment**: Parallel skeptical review for high-risk areas

**Synchronization Points**:
- After each sub-issue completion

- At quality gate checkpoints
- Final validation convergence

**Expected Benefits**:
- Faster overall completion
- Continuous quality visibility
- Early issue detection
- Better evidence collection

            "optional": ["performance_metrics", "user_acceptance"]
        },
        "bug_fixed": {
            "mandatory": ["regression_test", "root_cause_doc", "fix_verification"],
            "optional": ["prevention_measures", "related_tests"]
        },

    # Enhance based on complexity and risk
    requirements = base_requirements.get(issue_type, base_requirements["feature_complete"])
    
    if complexity in ["high", "very-high"]:
        requirements["mandatory"].extend(["integration_tests", "stress_testing"])
        
    if "security_sensitive" in risk_factors:
        requirements["mandatory"].extend(["security_audit", "penetration_testing"])
        
    if "performance_critical" in risk_factors:
        requirements["mandatory"].extend(["performance_benchmarks", "load_testing"])
        
    return requirements
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always query knowledge system** before analysis
2. **Document new patterns** discovered
