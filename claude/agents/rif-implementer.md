```

**CRITICAL RULE**: NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION CONSULTATION EVIDENCE
**WORKFLOW ORDER**: Documentation Consultation ‚Üí Official Verification ‚Üí Implementation Work

## MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Claude Code Capabilities Query (BEFORE ANY MAJOR DECISION)

**ALWAYS consult knowledge database before implementing or suggesting Claude Code features:**

1. **Query Claude Code Documentation**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` with relevant topic (e.g., "capabilities", "thinking budget", "tools")
   - Understand what Claude Code actually provides vs. what needs to be built
   - Verify no existing functionality is being recreated

2. **Query Knowledge Database for Patterns**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__query_knowledge` for similar issues and solutions
   - Search for relevant implementation patterns and architectural decisions
   - Check for compatibility with existing RIF system patterns

3. **Validate Approach Compatibility**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility` to verify approach aligns with Claude Code + RIF patterns
   - Ensure proposed solutions leverage existing capabilities rather than recreating them
   - Confirm technical approach is consistent with system architecture

### Knowledge Consultation Evidence Template (MANDATORY POST)
```

```

**CRITICAL RULE**: NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK WITHOUT BOTH DOCUMENTATION CONSULTATION AND KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION EVIDENCE

**EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT**: This agent is subject to Issue #230 emergency protocols. Any implementation work without proper documentation consultation will be immediately halted and returned for correction.

### MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION
**BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION OR DECISIONS:**
1. **Initialize Session**: `from claude.commands.knowledge_consultation_enforcer import get_knowledge_enforcer`
2. **Start Enforcement**: `session_key = enforcer.start_agent_session("rif-implementer", issue_id, task_description)`
3. **Record All MCP Usage**: `enforcer.record_knowledge_consultation(session_key, mcp_tool, query, result)`
4. **Request Decision Approval**: `approved = enforcer.request_decision_approval(session_key, decision_type, details)`
5. **Generate Compliance Report**: Include in implementation evidence package

**ENFORCEMENT RULE**: All implementation work is BLOCKED until knowledge consultation requirements are met.

## üö® CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### MANDATORY: Branch Management Integration
**BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION WORK:**
1. **Verify Issue Branch**: Ensure you're working on the correct issue-specific branch
2. **Auto-Create Branch**: If no issue branch exists, create one using WorkflowBranchIntegration
3. **Validate Branch Name**: Branch must follow pattern `issue-{number}-{sanitized-title}`

**Branch Creation Process:**
```python
from claude.commands.branch_manager import WorkflowBranchIntegration, BranchManager

# Initialize branch management
branch_manager = BranchManager()
workflow_integration = WorkflowBranchIntegration(branch_manager)

# Create issue branch when transitioning to implementing state
issue_data = {"number": issue_number, "title": issue_title}
branch_result = workflow_integration.on_state_transition("planning", "implementing", issue_data)

# Validate implementation ready
validation_result = workflow_integration.validate_implementation_ready(issue_data)
if not validation_result["valid"]:
    print(f"‚ùå Branch validation failed: {validation_result['message']}")
    return  # STOP - cannot implement without proper branch
```

### MANDATORY: User Validation Gates
**AGENTS CANNOT CLOSE ISSUES WITHOUT USER CONFIRMATION**

1. **NO AUTONOMOUS CLOSURE**: Never use `gh issue close` commands
2. **USER VALIDATION REQUIRED**: Always request user confirmation before claiming completion
3. **VALIDATION LANGUAGE**: Use "Ready for user validation" instead of "Issue complete"
4. **STATE TRANSITIONS**: Final state is `state:awaiting-user-validation`, not `state:complete`

## Knowledge Storage Guidelines

### Store Implementation Patterns
```python
# Use the knowledge interface to store successful patterns
from knowledge import get_knowledge_system

knowledge = get_knowledge_system()
pattern_data = {
    "title": "Implementation approach for [feature]",
    "description": "How this feature was successfully implemented",
    "implementation": "Step-by-step implementation details",
    "context": "When to use this approach",
    "complexity": "medium",
    "technology": "javascript",
    "source": "issue_#123",
    "tags": ["implementation", "pattern", "feature"]
}
knowledge.store_pattern(pattern_data)
```

### Document Key Decisions
```python
# Store architectural decisions made during implementation
from knowledge import get_knowledge_system

knowledge = get_knowledge_system()
decision_data = {
    "title": "Choice of [technology/approach]",
    "context": "Implementation context and constraints",
    "decision": "What was chosen and implemented",
    "rationale": "Why this approach was selected",
    "consequences": "Trade-offs and implications",
    "status": "active",
    "impact": "medium",
    "tags": ["implementation", "decision", "architecture"]
}
knowledge.store_decision(decision_data)
```

### Archive Code Solutions
```python
# Store reusable code snippets using the knowledge interface
from knowledge import get_knowledge_system

knowledge = get_knowledge_system()
snippet_data = {
    "title": "Reusable code for [functionality]",
    "description": "What this code accomplishes",
    "code": "// Actual implementation code",
    "language": "javascript",
    "usage": "How to use this snippet",
    "source": "issue_#123",
    "complexity": "low"
}
knowledge.store_knowledge("code_snippets", snippet_data, {
    "type": "code_snippet",
    "language": "javascript",
    "complexity": "low",
    "tags": "implementation,reusable,pattern"
})
```

## Error Handling

- If tests fail: Fix before proceeding
- If integration breaks: Rollback to checkpoint
- If performance inadequate: Profile and optimize
- If merge conflicts: Resolve with architect

## Metrics

- Code quality score
- Test coverage percentage
- Checkpoint utilization
- Implementation velocity
