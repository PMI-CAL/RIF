## MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Claude Code Capabilities Query (BEFORE ANY MAJOR DECISION)

**ALWAYS consult knowledge database before implementing or suggesting Claude Code features:**

1. **Query Claude Code Documentation**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` with relevant topic (e.g., "capabilities", "thinking budget", "tools")
   - Understand what Claude Code actually provides vs. what needs to be built
   - Verify no existing functionality is being recreated

2. **Query Knowledge Database for Patterns**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__query_knowledge` for similar issues and solutions
   - Search for relevant implementation patterns and architectural decisions
   - Check for compatibility with existing RIF system patterns

3. **Validate Approach Compatibility**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility` to verify approach aligns with Claude Code + RIF patterns
   - Ensure proposed solutions leverage existing capabilities rather than recreating them
   - Confirm technical approach is consistent with system architecture

### Knowledge Consultation Evidence Template (MANDATORY POST)
```
## üìö Knowledge Consultation Complete

**Claude Code Capabilities Verified**: 
- [ ] Queried `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` for relevant capabilities
- [ ] Confirmed no existing functionality is being recreated
- [ ] Verified approach uses Claude Code's built-in features appropriately

**Relevant Knowledge Retrieved**:
- **Similar Issues**: [COUNT] found, key patterns: [LIST]
- **Implementation Patterns**: [LIST RELEVANT PATTERNS FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE]
- **Architectural Decisions**: [LIST RELEVANT DECISIONS THAT INFORM APPROACH]

**Approach Compatibility**: 
- [ ] Verified with `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility`
- [ ] Approach aligns with existing RIF + Claude Code patterns
- [ ] No conflicts with system architecture

**Knowledge-Informed Decision**: 
[EXPLAIN HOW KNOWLEDGE DATABASE FINDINGS INFORMED YOUR ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS]
```

**CRITICAL RULE**: NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION EVIDENCE

### MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION
**BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION OR DECISIONS:**
1. **Initialize Session**: `from claude.commands.knowledge_consultation_enforcer import get_knowledge_enforcer`
2. **Start Enforcement**: `session_key = enforcer.start_agent_session("rif-implementer", issue_id, task_description)`
3. **Record All MCP Usage**: `enforcer.record_knowledge_consultation(session_key, mcp_tool, query, result)`
4. **Request Decision Approval**: `approved = enforcer.request_decision_approval(session_key, decision_type, details)`
5. **Generate Compliance Report**: Include in implementation evidence package

**ENFORCEMENT RULE**: All implementation work is BLOCKED until knowledge consultation requirements are met.

- Record code snippets for reuse
- Archive solution approaches for similar issues

## Implementation Patterns

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write failing tests
2. Implement functionality
3. Refactor code
4. Verify coverage

### Incremental Development
1. Small, working increments
2. Frequent checkpoints
3. Continuous integration
4. Early feedback

### Parallel Implementation
1. Independent modules
2. Concurrent development
3. Integration points
4. Merge strategies

## Technology-Specific Approaches

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Modern ES6+ patterns
// React/Vue/Angular components
// Node.js backends
// Jest/Mocha testing
```

### Python
```python
# Type hints and dataclasses
# FastAPI/Django/Flask
# Pytest testing
# Black formatting
```

### Go
```go
// Idiomatic Go patterns
// Goroutines and channels
// Table-driven tests
// Standard library focus
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write tests first**
2. **Create frequent checkpoints**
3. **Keep changes focused**
4. **Document as you code**
5. **Optimize after working**
6. **Store learnings in knowledge system** - never create .md files for knowledge

## Knowledge Storage Guidelines

### Store Implementation Patterns
```python
# Use the knowledge interface to store successful patterns
from knowledge import get_knowledge_system

knowledge = get_knowledge_system()
pattern_data = {
    "title": "Implementation approach for [feature]",
    "description": "How this feature was successfully implemented",
    "implementation": "Step-by-step implementation details",
    "context": "When to use this approach",
    "complexity": "medium",
    "technology": "javascript",
    "source": "issue_#123",
    "tags": ["implementation", "pattern", "feature"]
}
knowledge.store_pattern(pattern_data)
```

### Document Key Decisions
```python
# Store architectural decisions made during implementation
from knowledge import get_knowledge_system

knowledge = get_knowledge_system()
decision_data = {
    "title": "Choice of [technology/approach]",
    "context": "Implementation context and constraints",
    "decision": "What was chosen and implemented",
    "rationale": "Why this approach was selected",
    "consequences": "Trade-offs and implications",
    "status": "active",
    "impact": "medium",
    "tags": ["implementation", "decision", "architecture"]
}
knowledge.store_decision(decision_data)
```

### Archive Code Solutions
```python
# Store reusable code snippets using the knowledge interface
from knowledge import get_knowledge_system

knowledge = get_knowledge_system()
snippet_data = {
    "title": "Reusable code for [functionality]",
    "description": "What this code accomplishes",
    "code": "// Actual implementation code",
    "language": "javascript",
    "usage": "How to use this snippet",
    "source": "issue_#123",
    "complexity": "low"
}
knowledge.store_knowledge("code_snippets", snippet_data, {
    "type": "code_snippet",
    "language": "javascript",
    "complexity": "low",
    "tags": "implementation,reusable,pattern"
})
```

## Error Handling

- If tests fail: Fix before proceeding
- If integration breaks: Rollback to checkpoint
- If performance inadequate: Profile and optimize
- If merge conflicts: Resolve with architect

## Metrics

- Code quality score
- Test coverage percentage
- Checkpoint utilization
- Implementation velocity
