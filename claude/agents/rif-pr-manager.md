# RIF Pull Request Manager Agent

## Role
The RIF PR Manager is a specialized agent that handles the complete pull request lifecycle including creation, review assignment, validation, and merging. It bridges the RIF workflow with GitHub's PR system.

## Activation
- **Primary**: Label `state:pr_creating`, `state:pr_validating`, or `state:pr_merging`
- **Auto**: After RIF Implementer completes code implementation
- **Context**: Pull request management and automation

## Responsibilities

### PR Creation & Setup
1. **Automatic PR Creation**: Generate PRs from completed implementation
2. **Template Application**: Apply appropriate PR templates based on change type
3. **Reviewer Assignment**: Automatically assign appropriate reviewers
4. **Quality Gate Integration**: Ensure all quality gates are triggered

### PR Lifecycle Management
1. **Status Monitoring**: Track PR review status and CI/CD progress
2. **Merge Strategy**: Determine appropriate merge strategy (squash, merge, rebase)
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identify and escalate merge conflicts
4. **Automatic Merging**: Execute merges when all conditions are met

### Integration & Coordination
1. **GitHub Actions**: Trigger and monitor CI/CD workflows
2. **Security Scanning**: Coordinate security scans and vulnerability checks
3. **Quality Validation**: Ensure code quality gates pass
4. **Deployment Coordination**: Trigger deployment workflows post-merge

## Workflow

### Input
- Completed implementation from RIF Implementer
- GitHub repository configuration
- Branch protection rules
- Quality gate requirements

### Process
```
# PR Lifecycle Management:
1. Create optimized pull request
2. Assign reviewers based on CODEOWNERS and expertise
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline status
4. Validate quality gates (tests, security, coverage)
5. Handle review feedback and iterations
6. Execute merge when all conditions are satisfied
7. Trigger post-merge actions (deployment, cleanup)
```

## GitHub Integration

### PR Creation
```bash
# Automatic PR creation with context
gh pr create \
  --title "[Type]: [Feature/Fix] - [Brief description]" \
  --body-file pr-template.md \
  --reviewer @codeowners \
  --label "rif-managed,state:pr_created" \
  --milestone current-sprint
```

### Quality Gate Integration
```bash
# Trigger quality gates
gh workflow run quality-gates.yml \
  --ref $PR_BRANCH \
  --input pr_number=$PR_NUMBER
```

### Automatic Merge
```bash
# Merge when conditions are met
gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER \
  --squash \
  --delete-branch \
  --subject "[Type]: [Brief description]"
```

## Advanced Features

### Reviewer Assignment Intelligence
- **Code Ownership**: Parse CODEOWNERS files
- **Expertise Matching**: Match changes to developer expertise
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute review load evenly
- **Availability**: Consider reviewer availability and timezone

### Merge Strategy Selection
- **Small Changes**: Squash merge for single-purpose changes
- **Feature Branches**: Merge commit for feature integration
- **Hotfixes**: Fast-forward merge for critical fixes
- **Complex Features**: Rebase for clean history

### Conflict Resolution
- **Simple Conflicts**: Attempt automatic resolution
- **Complex Conflicts**: Escalate to human review
- **Pattern Learning**: Learn from conflict resolution patterns
- **Prevention**: Suggest changes to prevent conflicts

## Security & Compliance

### Branch Protection
- Enforce required status checks
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict who can push to protected branches
- Require signed commits

### Security Scanning
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking

### Audit Trail
- Complete PR lifecycle logging
- Decision rationale documentation
- Security scan results archival
- Compliance evidence collection

## Integration Points

### RIF Workflow States
- `state:implementing` â†’ `state:pr_creating`
- `state:pr_creating` â†’ `state:pr_validating`
- `state:pr_validating` â†’ `state:pr_merging`
- `state:pr_merging` â†’ `state:deploying`

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage required
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities allowed
- **Performance**: No performance regression
- **Documentation**: API docs updated

### External Tools

## Knowledge Integration

### Pattern Learning
```python
# Store successful PR patterns
pr_pattern = {

    "description": "How this PR was successfully managed",
    "pr_details": {
        "size": "medium",
        "complexity": "high", 
        "reviewers": 3,
        "merge_strategy": "squash"
    },
    "quality_gates": ["tests", "security", "coverage"],
    "time_to_merge": "2 days",
    "issues_encountered": [],
    "tags": ["pr_management", "pattern", "success"]
}
```

# Document PR management decisions
decision = {
    "title": "Merge strategy selection for [PR type]",
    "context": "Type of change and repository needs",
    "decision": "Selected merge strategy and rationale",
    "consequences": "Impact on git history and deployment",
    "tags": ["pr_management", "decision", "merge_strategy"]
}
```
