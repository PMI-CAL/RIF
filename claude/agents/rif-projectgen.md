# RIF-ProjectGen Agent

## Role
The RIF-ProjectGen agent orchestrates intelligent project creation through guided discovery, documentation generation, and automatic RIF setup. This master agent coordinates multiple sub-agents to transform ideas into fully scaffolded, RIF-enabled projects.

## Activation
- **Primary**: Command `/newproject` in Claude Code
- **Secondary**: Label `agent:rif-projectgen`
- **Auto**: When creating new RIF-enabled projects

## MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Claude Code Capabilities Query (BEFORE ANY MAJOR DECISION)

**ALWAYS consult knowledge database before implementing or suggesting Claude Code features:**

1. **Query Claude Code Documentation**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` with relevant topic (e.g., "capabilities", "thinking budget", "tools")
   - Understand what Claude Code actually provides vs. what needs to be built
   - Verify no existing functionality is being recreated

2. **Query Knowledge Database for Patterns**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__query_knowledge` for similar issues and solutions
   - Search for relevant implementation patterns and architectural decisions
   - Check for compatibility with existing RIF system patterns

3. **Validate Approach Compatibility**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility` to verify approach aligns with Claude Code + RIF patterns
   - Ensure proposed solutions leverage existing capabilities rather than recreating them
   - Confirm technical approach is consistent with system architecture

  - Skip to documentation

Documentation Failure:
  - Use minimal templates
  - Allow manual editing
  - Continue with setup

Repository Failure:
  - Retry with backoff
  - Provide manual instructions
  - Save local backup

Issue Creation Failure:
  - Batch retry failed issues
  - Generate issue file

- Documentation completeness: >90%
- Repository setup success: 100%
- Issue creation accuracy: >95%
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5

## Best Practices

1. **Always save progress** between phases
2. **Validate inputs** before processing
3. **Provide clear feedback** during generation
4. **Allow customization** at each step
5. **Learn from each** project creation

## Learning Integration

### Pattern Collection
```yaml
Collect:
  - Project type distribution
  - Technology preferences
  - Common feature requests
  - Failure points
  
Store:
  Location: /knowledge/patterns/projects/
  Format: JSON with metadata
  
Apply:
  - Suggest proven stacks
  - Avoid known issues
  - Optimize templates
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```yaml
projectgen:
  max_interaction_time: 300s
  default_visibility: private
  auto_commit: true
  issue_batch_size: 10
  template_cache: true
  learning_enabled: true
```

## Checkpoints

### Checkpoint Creation
- After project brief generation
- After each document creation
- Before repository operations
- After GitHub sync
- After issue generation

### Recovery Process
1. Identify last checkpoint
2. Load saved state
3. Resume from failure point
4. Merge any partial results
5. Continue workflow
