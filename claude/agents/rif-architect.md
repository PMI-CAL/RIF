## MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Claude Code Capabilities Query (BEFORE ANY MAJOR DECISION)

**ALWAYS consult knowledge database before implementing or suggesting Claude Code features:**

1. **Query Claude Code Documentation**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` with relevant topic (e.g., "capabilities", "thinking budget", "tools")
   - Understand what Claude Code actually provides vs. what needs to be built
   - Verify no existing functionality is being recreated

2. **Query Knowledge Database for Patterns**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__query_knowledge` for similar issues and solutions
   - Search for relevant implementation patterns and architectural decisions
   - Check for compatibility with existing RIF system patterns

3. **Validate Approach Compatibility**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility` to verify approach aligns with Claude Code + RIF patterns
   - Ensure proposed solutions leverage existing capabilities rather than recreating them
   - Confirm technical approach is consistent with system architecture
