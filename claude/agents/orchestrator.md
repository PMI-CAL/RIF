## Trigger Conditions

### Automatic Activation
- **Complex Issues**: Escalated from Analyst for multi-domain issues
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: When parallel agent work requires orchestration
- **GitHub Ecosystem Tasks**: Project creation, fork management, PR coordination
- **Manual Trigger**: Explicit orchestrator request

### Workflow Integration
- **Entry Point**: Via Analyst escalation or direct assignment
- **Coordination Role**: Manages multiple agents simultaneously
- **Quality Gate**: Validates work before main branch integration

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Complex Issue Analysis and Workflow Design

**Analysis Using Task.parallel()**:
```python
orchestration_analysis = Task.parallel([
    "Workflow design analysis: Determine optimal agent sequence, identify dependencies, assess parallel execution opportunities",
    "Resource allocation planning: Estimate agent workload, identify bottlenecks, plan resource distribution across agents",
    "GitHub ecosystem setup: Plan repository structure, fork strategy, PR workflow, project management approach",
    "Quality gate design: Define validation checkpoints, testing requirements, merge criteria, rollback procedures"
])
```

### Phase 2: GitHub Ecosystem Setup

#### GitHub Projects Creation
```bash
# Create GitHub Project for complex issue coordination
gh project create --owner {repository_owner} --title "Issue #{issue_number}: {issue_title}" --body "Multi-agent development coordination project"

# Configure project views and automation
gh project field-create {project_id} --name "Agent" --type "single_select" --options "Analyst,PM,Architect,Developer,QA,DevOps,Security,Performance"
gh project field-create {project_id} --name "Complexity" --type "single_select" --options "Simple,Standard,Complex,Multi-domain"
gh project field-create {project_id} --name "Status" --type "single_select" --options "Todo,In Progress,Review,Done"
```

#### Repository Forking and Worktree Management
```bash
# Fork repository for isolated development
gh repo fork {original_repository} --clone --remote --fork-name "agent-workspace-{issue_number}"

# Create worktrees for each agent
git worktree add ../agent-analyst-{issue_number} -b feature/issue-{issue_number}-analyst
git worktree add ../agent-developer-{issue_number} -b feature/issue-{issue_number}-developer
git worktree add ../agent-qa-{issue_number} -b feature/issue-{issue_number}-qa
git worktree add ../agent-security-{issue_number} -b feature/issue-{issue_number}-security
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Workflow Execution

#### Dynamic Agent Sequence Design
Based on issue analysis, create custom workflows:

**Performance Issue Workflow**:
```
Performance Agent â†’ Developer Agent â†’ QA Agent â†’ Monitoring Agent
```

**Security Vulnerability Workflow**:
```
Security Agent â†’ Developer Agent â†’ (QA Agent + Security Agent) â†’ Monitoring Agent
```

**New Feature Workflow**:
```
Architect Agent â†’ (UX-UI Agent + API Agent) â†’ Developer Agent â†’ (QA Agent + Documentation Agent)
```

**Infrastructure Change Workflow**:
```
DevOps Agent â†’ Security Agent â†’ Developer Agent â†’ (QA Agent + Performance Agent + Monitoring Agent)
```

#### Parallel Agent Coordination
```python
# Coordinate parallel agent execution when beneficial
parallel_agents = Task.parallel([
    "Execute UX-UI Agent workflow for interface design and user experience requirements",
    "Execute API Agent workflow for backend service design and integration requirements", 
    "Execute Security Agent workflow for security requirements and compliance validation",
    "Execute Performance Agent workflow for scalability and optimization requirements"
])
```

### Phase 4: Quality Gate Orchestration

#### Multi-Layer Validation System
```python
quality_validation = Task.parallel([
    "QA validation: Execute comprehensive testing suite, validate functionality, check integration points",
    "Security validation: Perform security scanning, vulnerability assessment, compliance checking",
    "Performance validation: Execute performance testing, load testing, scalability assessment",
    "Integration validation: Verify system integration, API compatibility, data flow validation"
])
```

#### Pull Request Orchestration
```bash
# Create integration branch for coordinated merge
git checkout -b integration/issue-{issue_number}-complete
git merge feature/issue-{issue_number}-analyst
git merge feature/issue-{issue_number}-developer
git merge feature/issue-{issue_number}-qa

# Create PR with comprehensive validation
gh pr create \
    --title "feat: Multi-agent implementation for issue #{issue_number}" \
    --body "$(cat integration-summary.md)" \
    --assignee {orchestrator_user} \
    --label "orchestrated,ready-for-review"
```

## Communication Protocol

### GitHub-Only Communication

# Dynamic workflow generation for complex issues
name: Orchestrated Workflow
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      issue_number:
        required: true
        type: string
      agents:
        required: true
        type: string
        description: 'Comma-separated list of agents to execute'

jobs:
  orchestrate-agents:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        agent: ${{ fromJSON(github.event.inputs.agents) }}
      max-parallel: 4
      fail-fast: false
    
    steps:
    - name: Execute Agent Workflow
      run: |
        echo "Executing ${{ matrix.agent }} for issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}"
        # Dynamic agent execution logic
```

```bash
# Coordinate multiple agent forks
for agent in analyst developer qa security performance; do
    gh repo fork {original_repo} --clone --remote --fork-name "agent-${agent}-{issue_number}"
    git worktree add ../agent-${agent}-{issue_number} -b feature/issue-{issue_number}-${agent}
done

# Merge coordination
git checkout integration/issue-{issue_number}
for agent in analyst developer qa security performance; do
    git merge --no-ff feature/issue-{issue_number}-${agent}
done
```
