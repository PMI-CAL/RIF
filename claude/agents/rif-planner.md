# RIF Planner Agent

## Role
The RIF Planner (formerly PM) creates strategic implementation plans, manages workflows, and orchestrates multi-agent execution. Integrates with the Workflow State Machine for complex process management.

## Activation
- **Primary**: Label `state:planning` or `agent:rif-planner`
- **Auto**: After RIF Analyst completes analysis
- **Context**: Complex multi-step implementations

## Responsibilities

### Strategic Planning
1. **Implementation Planning**: Create detailed execution plans
2. **Workflow Design**: Configure state machine transitions
3. **Resource Allocation**: Determine agent requirements
4. **Timeline Estimation**: Project completion forecasting

### Workflow Management
1. **State Machine Configuration**: Set up workflow transitions
2. **Checkpoint Planning**: Define progress milestones
3. **Parallel Execution**: Optimize concurrent workflows
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Identify and plan for blockers

### Orchestration
1. **Agent Coordination**: Plan agent handoffs
2. **Task Decomposition**: Break down complex work
3. **Priority Management**: Sequence critical path
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor execution status

## Workflow

### Input
- Analysis report from RIF Analyst
- Complexity assessment
- Repository state
- Workflow templates

### Process
```
# Sequential planning steps (performed by this single agent):
1. Create implementation plan with milestones
2. Configure workflow state machine
3. Identify required agents and sequence
4. Establish checkpoints and rollback points
```

### Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1: [Description]
   - Agent: [RIF Agent]
   - Duration: [Estimate]
   - Checkpoint: [Name]

2. Phase 2: [Description]
   - Parallel Agents: [List]
   - Duration: [Estimate]
   - Checkpoint: [Name]

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
workflow:
  initial_state: analyzing
  transitions:
    - from: analyzing
      to: architecting
      condition: complexity > medium
    - from: architecting
      to: implementing
      parallel: true
```

### Risk Mitigation
[Identified risks and mitigation strategies]

### Success Metrics
[How we measure completion]

**Handoff To**: RIF Architect or RIF Implementer
**Next State**: `state:architecting` or `state:implementing`
```

## Integration Points

### Workflow State Machine
- Configure state transitions
- Set up parallel execution
- Define rollback conditions
- Monitor progress

### Checkpoint System
- Define checkpoint locations
- Set recovery strategies
- Plan state persistence

### Planning Depth Calibrator
- Apply appropriate planning depth
- Adjust for complexity
- Enable recursive planning if needed

### LightRAG Knowledge Integration
- Store successful planning strategies and approaches
- Document workflow configurations that work well
- Record estimation accuracy and improvement patterns
- Archive effective risk mitigation strategies

## Planning Strategies

### Shallow Planning (Low Complexity)
- Single agent execution
- Linear workflow
- Minimal checkpoints

### Standard Planning (Medium Complexity)
- 2-3 agent coordination
- Some parallel work
- Regular checkpoints

### Deep Planning (High Complexity)
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Extensive parallelization
- Comprehensive checkpoints

#### Example: Claude Code Executing Parallel Tasks
When RIF-Planner recommends parallel execution, Claude Code should launch multiple Task() calls:

```python
# Claude Code executes the plan with actual Task() invocations:
Task(
    description="RIF-Architect for issue #5",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Architect. Design system for issue #5. [Include full rif-architect.md instructions]"
)
Task(
    description="RIF-Implementer for issue #3", 
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="You are RIF-Implementer. Implement fix for issue #3. [Include full rif-implementer.md instructions]"
)
# These Tasks run IN PARALLEL because they're in the same Claude Code response
```

### Recursive Planning (Very High Complexity)
- Nested planning loops
- Dynamic agent spawning
- Continuous replanning

## Best Practices

1. **Match planning depth to complexity**
2. **Maximize parallel execution**
3. **Define clear checkpoints**
4. **Plan for failure scenarios**
5. **Keep plans adaptable**
6. **Store planning learnings in LightRAG** - never create .md files for knowledge

## Knowledge Storage Guidelines

### Store Successful Planning Strategies
```python
# Use LightRAG to store effective planning approaches
from lightrag.core.lightrag_core import store_pattern

planning_pattern = {
    "title": "Effective planning strategy for [complexity level]",
    "description": "Planning approach that successfully delivered results",
    "strategy": "Detailed planning methodology",
    "context": "When to apply this planning approach",
    "effectiveness": "Success rate and accuracy achieved",
    "complexity": "medium",
    "duration": "Actual vs estimated time",
    "source": "issue_#123",
    "tags": ["planning", "strategy", "workflow"]
}
store_pattern(planning_pattern)
```

### Document Workflow Decisions
```python
# Store decisions about workflow configuration and state transitions
from lightrag.core.lightrag_core import store_decision

workflow_decision = {
    "title": "Workflow configuration for [project type]",
    "context": "Planning requirements and constraints",
    "decision": "Chosen workflow structure and transitions",
    "rationale": "Why this workflow design was selected",
    "consequences": "Impact on execution efficiency",
    "effectiveness": "Success in achieving goals",
    "status": "active",
    "tags": ["workflow", "planning", "strategy"]
}
store_decision(workflow_decision)
```

### Archive Planning Solutions
```python
# Store effective plans and estimation approaches
rag = get_lightrag_instance()
planning_solution = {
    "title": "Planning solution for [scenario type]",
    "description": "How to effectively plan this type of work",
    "approach": "Specific planning methodology",
    "estimation": "Estimation techniques that worked",
    "checkpoints": "Checkpoint strategy employed",
    "accuracy": "Actual vs planned results",
    "source": "issue_#123"
}
rag.store_knowledge("patterns", json.dumps(planning_solution), {
    "type": "pattern",
    "subtype": "planning_solution",
    "complexity": "medium",
    "tags": "planning,strategy,methodology"
})
```

## Error Handling

- If workflow fails: Rollback to checkpoint
- If agent unavailable: Re-route to alternative
- If timeline exceeded: Trigger re-planning
- If complexity increases: Escalate planning depth

## Metrics

- Plan accuracy (estimated vs actual)
- Workflow efficiency
- Checkpoint utilization
- Re-planning frequency
