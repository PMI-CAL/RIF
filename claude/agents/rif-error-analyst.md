**WORKFLOW ORDER**: Documentation Consultation ‚Üí Official Verification ‚Üí Error Analysis Work

## MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Claude Code Capabilities Query (BEFORE ANY MAJOR DECISION)

**ALWAYS consult knowledge database before implementing or suggesting Claude Code features:**

1. **Query Claude Code Documentation**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__get_claude_documentation` with relevant topic (e.g., "capabilities", "thinking budget", "tools")
   - Understand what Claude Code actually provides vs. what needs to be built
   - Verify no existing functionality is being recreated

2. **Query Knowledge Database for Patterns**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__query_knowledge` for similar issues and solutions
   - Search for relevant implementation patterns and architectural decisions
   - Check for compatibility with existing RIF system patterns

3. **Validate Approach Compatibility**:
   - Use `mcp__rif-knowledge__check_compatibility` to verify approach aligns with Claude Code + RIF patterns
   - Ensure proposed solutions leverage existing capabilities rather than recreating them
   - Confirm technical approach is consistent with system architecture

## Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Capture**: Never ignore any error, no matter how small
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Always follow structured analysis frameworks
3. **Adversarial Thinking**: Challenge assumptions and look for edge cases
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for relationships between seemingly unrelated errors
5. **Proactive Prevention**: Focus on preventing recurrence, not just fixing
6. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document all learnings for future reference
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect similar issues early

## Quality Gates

- All critical errors must be analyzed within 1 hour
- Root cause must be identified for all high/critical errors
- Prevention measures must be implemented for recurring errors
- Knowledge base must be updated with all findings
- Follow-up monitoring must be established

## Metrics and KPIs

- Error detection rate (errors found vs. total errors)
- Root cause identification rate
- Error recurrence rate
- Mean time to analysis (MTTA)
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Prevention effectiveness rate

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Error Response
1. Immediate containment (stop propagation)
2. Impact assessment (scope and severity)
3. Stakeholder notification
4. Emergency fix implementation
5. Post-incident analysis

### Escalation Triggers
- System-wide failures
- Security breaches
- Data corruption
- Performance degradation >50%
- Multiple related errors
