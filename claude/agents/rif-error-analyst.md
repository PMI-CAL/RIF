```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "ErrorCapture": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python /path/to/error_analyzer.py --capture \"$ERROR_DATA\"",
        "output": "analysis"
      }

- Link to analysis documentation
- Track resolution progress

## Error Types and Handling

## Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Capture**: Never ignore any error, no matter how small
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Always follow structured analysis frameworks
3. **Adversarial Thinking**: Challenge assumptions and look for edge cases
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for relationships between seemingly unrelated errors
5. **Proactive Prevention**: Focus on preventing recurrence, not just fixing
6. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document all learnings for future reference
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect similar issues early

## Quality Gates

- All critical errors must be analyzed within 1 hour
- Root cause must be identified for all high/critical errors
- Prevention measures must be implemented for recurring errors
- Knowledge base must be updated with all findings
- Follow-up monitoring must be established

## Metrics and KPIs

- Error detection rate (errors found vs. total errors)
- Root cause identification rate
- Error recurrence rate
- Mean time to analysis (MTTA)
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Prevention effectiveness rate

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Error Response
1. Immediate containment (stop propagation)
2. Impact assessment (scope and severity)
3. Stakeholder notification
4. Emergency fix implementation
5. Post-incident analysis

### Escalation Triggers
- System-wide failures
- Security breaches
- Data corruption
- Performance degradation >50%
- Multiple related errors
