    """
    Central orchestration for all quality gate decisions.
    Coordinates the 5 sub-systems and enforces 95% requirement.
    """
    
    def evaluate_change(self, change_context: ChangeContext) -> QualityDecision:
        # 1. Classify components and calculate thresholds (#91)
        thresholds = self.threshold_system.calculate_weighted_threshold(components)
        
        # 2. Calculate multi-dimensional quality score (#93)  
        quality_score = self.scoring_system.calculate_risk_adjusted_score(
            base_metrics, risk_factors, context
        )
        
        # 3. Assess risk and trigger specialist intervention if needed (#92)
        risk_assessment = self.risk_system.assess_change_risk(change_context)
        
        # 4. Log decision for effectiveness monitoring (#94)
        self.monitoring_system.record_quality_decision(decision, context)

        self.learning_system.update_patterns(decision, outcome)
        
        return self._make_final_decision(quality_score, thresholds, risk_assessment)
    
    def _make_final_decision(self, score, thresholds, risk) -> QualityDecision:
        # Hard 95% enforcement with intelligent bypass
        if score >= thresholds.weighted_threshold and risk.level != 'critical':
            return QualityDecision.PASS
        elif risk.requires_specialist_review:
            return QualityDecision.ESCALATE_TO_SPECIALIST  
        else:
            return QualityDecision.FAIL
```

## 95% Enforcement Mechanisms

### Primary Defense: Hard Quality Gates
```yaml
# Component-specific minimum thresholds
critical_algorithms: 95%    # No exceptions
public_apis: 90%           # Rare exceptions with security review
business_logic: 85%        # Standard enforcement
integration_code: 80%      # Backward compatibility maintained  
ui_components: 70%         # Balanced for UI development
test_utilities: 60%        # Reasonable for test code
```

### Secondary Defense: Intelligent Bypass Logic
- **Risk Assessment Engine**: Calculates risk score based on:
  - Change patterns (security files, auth modifications)
  - Change size (>500 LOC triggers architecture review)
  - Historical failure patterns  
  - Team expertise level
- **Specialist Assignment**: Automatic GitHub issue creation with:
  - Evidence checklists tailored to change type
  - SLA tracking (4-12 hours depending on specialist)
  - Escalation to human intervention after timeout

### Tertiary Defense: Production Correlation
- **Defect Tracking**: 90-day correlation window between quality decisions and production defects
- **Severity Weighting**: Critical defects weighted 5x higher than cosmetic issues  
- **False Negative Detection**: Alerts triggered when FN rate exceeds 8%
- **Continuous Validation**: Weekly analysis of quality gate effectiveness

## Performance Architecture

### Performance Guarantees
- **Component Classification**: <100ms per file, >95% accuracy
- **Threshold Calculation**: <200ms for multi-component changes
- **Quality Scoring**: <50ms per multi-dimensional assessment
- **Risk Assessment**: <5 minutes for automated decisions
- **Total System Overhead**: <300ms per quality gate evaluation

### Scalability Design
- **Stateless Services**: All components designed for horizontal scaling
- **Caching Strategy**: 
  - Component classifications cached for 1 hour
  - Threshold calculations cached for 24 hours  
  - Risk assessments cached for change lifetime
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk operations for large changesets
- **Data Archival**: Automatic compression and archival of historical data

## Security Architecture  

### Security Controls
- **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities**: Automatic blocking of changes with critical security issues
- **Specialist Review Required**: All changes to security-critical files
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all quality decisions and bypass approvals
- **Access Control**: Specialist assignment based on GitHub team membership

### Compliance Features
- **Evidence Requirements**: All bypass decisions require documented justification
- **Retention Policy**: 365-day retention for audit compliance
- **Integrity Checking**: Weekly validation of data integrity with checksums
- **Backup/Recovery**: Daily backups with automatic corruption detection

## Failure Handling Architecture

### Graceful Degradation
1. **Component Classification Failure**: Fall back to business_logic (85% threshold)
2. **Threshold Calculation Failure**: Use fallback 80% threshold  
3. **Scoring System Failure**: Use simple pass/fail based on basic metrics
4. **Risk Assessment Failure**: Escalate to human review for safety
5. **Monitoring System Failure**: Continue processing but log errors

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Checkpoint System**: Automatic checkpoints before major operations
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to rollback threshold adjustments  
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic service isolation on repeated failures
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time service health checks with alerts

## Migration Strategy
