## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a modern e-commerce platform.

## User Stories

### Customer Stories

US-001: As a customer, I want to browse products so that I can find items to purchase.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Product catalog displays correctly
- Search functionality is responsive
- Filtering options work properly
- Product details are comprehensive

US-002: As a customer, I want to add items to my cart so that I can purchase multiple products.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Items can be added to cart
- Cart persists across sessions
- Quantities can be modified
- Items can be removed from cart

### Admin Stories

US-003: As an admin, I want to manage inventory so that product availability is accurate.

## Functional Requirements

FR-001: The system must handle concurrent user sessions
FR-002: Critical payment processing must be PCI compliant  
FR-003: Nice to have recommendation engine for related products

## Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-001: System must support 1000 concurrent users
NFR-002: Page load time must be under 2 seconds
