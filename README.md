## Quick Start

### 1. Copy Framework to Your Project

```bash
# For existing projects
cd /path/to/your/project
cp -r /path/to/framework/claude .claude
cp -r /path/to/framework/config framework-config
cp -r /path/to/framework/docs framework-docs

# Initialize framework
git add .claude/ framework-config/ framework-docs/
git commit -m "Add development framework integration"
```

### 2. Technology Detection

The framework automatically detects your technology stack:

```bash
# Framework detects technology from:
# - package.json (Node.js/JavaScript)
# - requirements.txt, pyproject.toml (Python)
# - pom.xml, build.gradle (Java)
# - Cargo.toml (Rust)
# - go.mod (Go)
# - composer.json (PHP)
# - Gemfile (Ruby)
# - *.csproj, *.sln (C#/.NET)
```

### 3. Start Development with AI Assistance

```bash
# Create an issue to trigger agent workflow
gh issue create --title "Implement new feature" --body "Feature description"
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "workflow-state:planning"

# Agents will automatically analyze and provide guidance
# Check .claude/agents/ for available agent workflows
```
