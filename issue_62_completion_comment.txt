# Calculate weight for agent decision
context = {'domain': 'security', 'confidence': 0.85, 'complexity': 'high'}
weight = calc.calculate_weight('rif-security', context)

# Get ensemble weights for group decision  
agents = ['rif-security', 'rif-validator', 'rif-implementer']
ensemble_weights = calc.calculate_ensemble_weights(agents, context)
```
