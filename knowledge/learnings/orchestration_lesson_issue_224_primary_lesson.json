  "title": "Avoid Multi-Issue Accelerator Anti-Pattern",
  "category": "anti-pattern",
  "description": "The Multi-Issue Accelerator anti-pattern occurs when attempting to create a single Task agent to handle multiple issues in parallel, which violates Claude Code's execution model and creates performance bottlenecks.",
  "problem_context": "User requested orchestration to handle multiple open issues. Orchestrator incorrectly attempted to create single 'Multi-Issue Accelerator' agent instead of multiple Task invocations.",
  "solution_approach": "Replace single multi-issue Task with multiple specialized Tasks launched in one response. Each Task handles exactly one issue with appropriate specialized agent.",
  "prevention_measures": [
    "Always validate: One Task = One Issue = One Specialized Agent",
    "Use proper parallel launching: Multiple Task() in single response",
    "Validate task descriptions don't contain multiple issue numbers",
    "Ensure agent names match standard RIF agents (RIF-Implementer, RIF-Validator, etc.)",
    "Include proper agent instructions in all Task prompts"
