Advisory Decision: PASS with CONCERNS regarding production security testing. The system successfully detects project requirements, maps them to appropriate MCP servers, loads them securely with resource optimization, provides real-time health monitoring, and demonstrates robust error handling. Implementation is READY FOR PRODUCTION with understanding that full security validation requires actual MCP server instances."
