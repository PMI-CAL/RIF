  "consequences": {
    "positive": [
      "Academic foundation ensures methodology rigor and industry best practices",
      "Historical RIF analysis provides real-world validation patterns", 
      "Parallel prototyping optimizes development timeline (2 days vs 4 days sequential)",
      "Expert validation ensures human alignment meets 85% target requirement",
      "Integration with existing RIF-Validator patterns reduces implementation risk"
    ],
    "negative": [
      "Higher complexity requiring multiple specialized agents",
      "Risk of NLP accuracy not meeting 90% target in initial prototype",
      "Expert validation scheduling dependency could extend timeline",
      "Integration complexity with existing quality gate systems"
